# Vacay - a travel bucket list journaling python project

Description: This is my first project as part of the CodeClan professional software development course. The brief was:

> ## Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.

> MVP:
> The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
> The user should be able to create and edit countries
> Each country should have one or more cities to visit
> The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
> The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see

The app lets a user add countries, places to those countries, and journal entries at both the country and place level. 
The user is able to add, update and delete countries, place and entries.

This project was limited to using **Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, CSS** and **Jinja.**
